<!--
The developer used the syntax {\{job.title\}} to access the title of the job, but we used the syntax {\{job['title']\}} to access the title of the job, because we are using a list of dictionaries, and not a list of objects. 
The syntax {\{job.title\}} is used to access the title of the job, when the job is an object, and not a dictionary.

In reality, they both work. So the robust syntax is the one with the period, because it works with both dictionaries and objects, so it is more useful in case job changes from a dictionary to an object, or vice versa.

If you try to access an entry that is not there in the database, you will only see the h3 elements "Title" "Location" "Salary" BOT NOT the corresponding p elements, because the if statement will not be true, and the corresponding p elements will not be rendered.

ul tag stands for unordered list tag, and it is used to create a bulleted list of items, without any particular order. The items in the list are enclosed in li tags, and they are separated by commas.
li tags stand for list item tags, and they are used to create a list of items, without any particular order. The items in the list are enclosed in li tags, and they are separated by commas.

we used the class="list-centered" to center the list, and we used the "style=list-style-position: inside;" to center the bullets, and "padding-left: 0;" to remove the default padding so that the bullets are centered.

We Completed the responsibilities and requirements sections of the job page, by using the data from the database. 
Implement (you only need one escape backslash, always inside the curly brackets, preferrably just after the left one): 

"{\% for line in job.responsibilities.split("\n") %}
  <li>{\{line}}</li>
{\% endfor %}" 

so that every newline makes as separator between the items in the list.

The same goes for the requirements section.
"{\% for line in job.requirements.split("\n") %}
  <li>{\{line}}</li>
{\% endfor %}" 

TODO: solve the missing rendering of the bootstrap logo in the navbar of the job page.
